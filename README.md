## User story 

As a comic book fan, I want to have quick and easy access to information about my favorite Marvel superheroes, so that I can learn more about them and their stories.

I open the Marvel superhero index on my phone and am presented with a search bar. I can typed for exemple "Spider-Man."

The page for Spider-Man loads and I see a brief overview of the character, including his real name (Peter Parker), his powers (spider-like abilities such as wall-crawling and superhuman strength), and his origin story (bitten by a radioactive spider).

I then see a list of notable Youtube videos, and cover images. I tap on "The Amazing Spider-Man #1" and am taken to a page with more information about the video desccription. 

I am able to easily navigate through the index and find all the information I need about Spider-Man. I can also search for any other marvel character I am interested in.
